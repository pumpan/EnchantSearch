## 📝 Overview

**EnchantSearch** enhances the default **CraftFrame** in WoW 1.12.1 by adding a real-time
search box for enchantments.

The addon is designed for players with many enchants and recipes, making it fast and
easy to locate specific enchants without manually expanding and scrolling through
the entire list.

The addon is written **specifically for the WoW 1.12.1 API** and avoids modern UI
functions to ensure full Vanilla compatibility.
